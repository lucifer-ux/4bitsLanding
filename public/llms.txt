4bits - LLM Summary

Summary
4bits is a buy-once, own-forever personal storage device designed to give you cloud-like access without actually being the cloud. Your data lives on a single device you own, while still being accessible from anywhere.

Who it's for
4bits is built for individuals and families who want the convenience of modern cloud storage without subscriptions, vendor lock-in, or handing control of their data to third parties. It's especially suited to people who value privacy, long-term ownership, and an organized digital life.

Key capabilities
- Cloud-like access, not the cloud: Reach your files from anywhere while keeping everything on your own device.

- Context preservation: Files retain their meaning and relationships across folders and sections.
- Auto-organization: Content is automatically organized into clear sections to reduce manual sorting.
- Large, flexible storage: Devices start at 5TB and can be customized.
- Strong security model: Data remains fully secure on a single device you control.
- Family support: Dedicated private folders for each family member, all on one shared device.
